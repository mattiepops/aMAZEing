# This is aMAZEing!
________

Wecome ***Kelian*** and/or ***Emily*** to my masterpiece! :bowtie:

Please find the **maze project link** [here] (https://mattiepops.github.io/aMAZEing/).

### Reason for this project:
________

We were asked to put our newly discovered JS skills to test, by creating a basic 2D maze game and coding an automatic level advancement functionality into the game. 

We were asked to code all elements and functions directly in JS.


Bonus Level 4
_____________

If you think you're super cool because you managed to complete the first 3 levels, good luck completing level 4!

### What did I learn from this experience:

I learned how to convert a .txt file into an actual maze, by arranging a class to each element of the .txt file and then assigning style rules to each class. Furthermore, I have learned how to generate multiple levels of the maze into my code, each new level appearing after completing the previous one. I am very thankful to indian guys on Youtube, and also to my colleagues at BeCode for helping me out when I needed help. 

## Problems encountered:

I was stuck on the movements of my crackhead Mario in the maze, and I tried a few different ways to code the function of the addEventListener, and eventually after 4 completely different attempts, I have managed to make the italian man get off his ass and move!

Later on, it was really not obvious for me how to even begin thinking about adding multiple levels to my maze, and how I would code all of them so that the next level starts when you complete the current level. I had a crash course with Maxime and Axel, from Jean, who was super patient and explained us step by step how to do it. 

I added a goomba as an enemy, but unfortunateily I did not know how to make it so that if the player collides with the goomba, the level is restarted.

Finally, I was not able to make it so that the timer and goomba appear in every level. 

### Conclusion
_____

In the end, I powered through and managed to create an amazeing maze!

Thank you for reading this readme and giving me feedback on the project :punch:
